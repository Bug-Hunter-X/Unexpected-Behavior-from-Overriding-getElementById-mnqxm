This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML where overriding the built-in `getElementById` method causes unexpected behavior. The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version.  Overriding core DOM methods is generally bad practice and can break other parts of your application.  Always use the standard methods to manipulate the DOM.
